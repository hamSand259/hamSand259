- 👋 Hi, I’m @hamSand259
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and answering questions I didn't know I had.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science strategies and fun coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything that is interesting. I'm not sure that I have much to contribute right now, since I'm learning, but I am all about helping others when I can. What I find interesting changes regularly. So who knows.
- 📫 How to reach me not sure yet. Still learning and I want to protect my email and text from spam...so right now. just here. You probably know more than I do.
